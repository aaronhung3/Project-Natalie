    <p>A message to my beloved Natalie:</p>
    <span>Happy 1 year anniversary! It has been the biggest joy to be able to experience and cross the one year line with you. Through all the ups and downs, I've only felt my love for you growing more and more each day, and the excitement of spending more time with you increasing. I'm not the most romantic person, or the best boyfriend, but despite all my wrongdoings, you've embraced my flaws and helped my change for the better. I really appreciate you and the fact that you entered my life makes me feel like I've won the lottery. </span>
