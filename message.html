                        <strong>A message to my beloved Natalie:</strong><br><br>
                        <span>Happy 1 year anniversary! It has been my biggest joy to be able to experience and cross the one year line with you. Through all the ups and downs, I've only felt my love for you growing more and more each day, and the feeling of wanting to spend more time with you increasing. I'm not the most romantic person, or the best boyfriend, but despite all my wrongdoings, you've embraced my flaws and helped my change for the better. I really appreciate you and the fact that you entered my life makes me feel like I've won the lottery. You deserve everything in this world and I hope that I can help you gain that everything. You are sincere, beautiful, fun to be around, and the light of my life. I cherish every single moment with you and the moments that will come. I love you with all my heart and I look forward to spending the rest of my life with you.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With every ounce of love,
                        <br>
